It is mainly used with tight-binding Hamiltonians obtained from wannier90 or from the FPLO DFT code but any tight-binding can be used. A python program for generating sd models that is also interfaced to the linear response code is also included. The code utilizes Kubo formula with constant Gamma approximation to calculate conductivity and the anomalous Hall effect, spin Hall effect and the current induced spin-polarization, which gives rise to the spin-orbit torque. Other response quantities can be easily implemented.

SIESTA's efficiency stems from the use of a basis set of strictly-localized atomic orbitals. A very important feature of the code is that its accuracy and cost can be tuned in a wide range, from quick exploratory calculations to highly accurate simulations matching the quality of other approaches, such as plane-wave methods.

The  methods and algorithms used in OpenMX and their implementation are carefully designed  for the realization of large-scale ab initio electronic structure calculations on  parallel computers based on the MPI or MPI/OpenMP hybrid parallelism. The efficient  implementation of DFT enables us to investigate electronic, magnetic, and geometrical  structures of a wide variety of materials such as bulk materials, surfaces,  interfaces, liquids, and low-dimensional materials. Systems consisting of 1000 atoms can be treated using the conventional diagonalization method if several hundreds  cores on a parallel computer are used.
